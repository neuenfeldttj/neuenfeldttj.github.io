        text: "Hi! I'm TJ Neuenfeldt and I'm currently a junior studying computer science at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, with a minor in music. Robotics has always intrigued me since joining FIRST Robotics in elementary school. Having taken numerous robotics classes at Michigan, I would love to explore this field more. I'm excited to take a path planning and mapping course this upcoming semester! Similarly, the new buzzword 'machine learning/AI' has interested me since early high school. Since recently taking an introductory course, I have started to do some ML projects (which you can see in the Projects section) using Pytorch. I am also expanding my knowledge researching transformers and CNN architectures.",

        text: "I've been interested in music since a young age. Starting off with violin at age 5 and then moving onto alto saxophone and bassoon at the end of elementary school, my passion for music grew. I am now in the Michigan Marching Band and it has been one of the best experiences of my life! While it is a lot of work (about 20 hours during a game week), I have made so many friends and learned so much about time management and leadership. This past year, we got to go to the Rose Bowl (shown in the photo) and the National Championship. These are memories I'll hold forever.",

        text: "Since the beginning of freshman year, I have been involved with the Michigan Mars Rover Team (MRover). As a project team, we compete annually with other university rovers around the world. A friend of mine was on the teleoperations team when I joining, so I thought I'd give it a shot. It proved to be something really interesting as I didn't experiment with web design prior. Sophomore year I became the teleoperations lead, where I would manage all of my team's tasks and ensure deadlines were met. Linked in the Projects section is the teleoperations GitHub. I've learned a lot over this past year and it culminated in seeing the user interface in full operation during the University Rover Challenge in Utah",
